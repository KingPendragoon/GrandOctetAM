No Test Macro:

Please make sure that Default party sort is enabled in FF (Tank, Healer, DPS) and that in triggernometry it is configured under
 "Options > Edit Configuration > FInal Fantasy XIV" that player list set to "Custom Order" and is in the proper order as well of Tanks, Healers, DPS. 

This is a lot simpler of Auto Marker then that used in the UwU Gaols auto marker as priority is not needed.  
But the basic set up of hotbar and triggernometry settings is the same.  For a visual guide please reference only the setup section
of my uwu gaols readme at https://github.com/KingPendragoon/FFXIVJobPrioGaolAutoMarker/blob/main/README.md

You will need F1-F9 set up with keybinds on the hotbar.
